# ðŸ’˜ Dating Algorithm Using Unsupervised Machine Learning

An ongoing project aimed at developing a dating algorithm using **Unsupervised Machine Learning** techniques, including **Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC)** and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, to cluster user profiles and identify similar profiles.

---

## ðŸš€ **Project Overview**
This project aims to improve the dating experience by clustering user profiles and recommending similar profiles based on feature and text similarity. The algorithm uses **Unsupervised Machine Learning** techniques to optimize matchmaking by calculating correlations within clusters. 

---

## ðŸš¨ **Disclaimer**
- The **CSV files** containing user profile data used in this project are **generated** for the purpose of algorithm development and testing. They do not represent real user data or any real-world dating profiles. The data has been created partly to avoid violating the privacy of real users.

- This specific implementation of the algorithm **is not intended for direct use in any dating application**. Instead, it serves as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the development and refinement of matchmaking techniques using **Unsupervised Machine Learning**.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Key Features**
- **Clustering:** Profiles are grouped using **Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering** to identify similar users.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** **PCA** is used to reduce data complexity while preserving key features.
- **Similarity Calculation:** Identifies the **top 15 most similar profiles** by calculating correlations within clusters.
- **Evaluation:** Uses **Silhouette Coefficient** and **Davies-Bouldin Score** to evaluate clustering performance and determine the optimal number of clusters.

## ðŸ§  **Machine Learning Approach**
The algorithm applies **Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering** to group profiles and **PCA** to reduce dimensionality, enabling the system to find similar profiles based on both **feature-based** and **text-based** similarities.
